A robotic scrub nurse assists surgeons using RNN-based speech recognition to identify requested instruments. YOLOv5 computer vision identifies instruments on a tray. The robot picks the correct instrument with an electromagnetic gripper and places it on a destination tray. A modified T050000 Tinker kit Braccio robot controls the gripper.
